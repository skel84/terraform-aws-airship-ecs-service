  # The following hack is required to overcome TF automatic type conversions which lead to issues with the resulting json types.
  # Conversion happens by using the built-in `replace` function in this order:
  #  - Convert `""`, `{}`, `[]`, and `[""]` to `null`
  #  - Convert `"true"` and `"false"` to `true` and `false`
  #  - Convert quoted numbers (e.g. `"123"`) to `123`.
  # Environment variables are kept as strings.
